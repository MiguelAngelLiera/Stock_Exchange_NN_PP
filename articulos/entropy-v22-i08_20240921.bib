ABSTRACT = {The prediction of stock groups values has always been attractive and challenging for shareholders due to its inherent dynamics, non-linearity, and complex nature. This paper concentrates on the future prediction of stock market groups. Four groups named diversified financials, petroleum, non-metallic minerals, and basic metals from Tehran stock exchange were chosen for experimental evaluations. Data were collected for the groups based on 10 years of historical records. The value predictions are created for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days in advance. Various machine learning algorithms were utilized for prediction of future values of stock market groups. We employed decision tree, bagging, random forest, adaptive boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Ten technical indicators were selected as the inputs into each of the prediction models. Finally, the results of the predictions were presented for each technique based on four metrics. Among all algorithms used in this paper, LSTM shows more accurate results with the highest model fitting ability. In addition, for tree-based models, there is often an intense competition between Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.},
